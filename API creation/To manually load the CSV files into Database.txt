To manually load the CSV files into a SQLite database before running the generate_report() function, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have SQLite installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official SQLite website: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your CSV files and the Python script (app.py or any other name you used) are located.

3. Launch the SQLite command-line interface by executing the following command:

    sqlite3 store.db ##code

This will create or connect to a SQLite database file named store.db.

4. Once you are in the SQLite command-line interface, run the following commands to create the necessary tables for the CSV data:


CREATE TABLE store_status (
    store_id INTEGER,
    timestamp_utc TEXT,
    status TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE store_hours (
    store_id INTEGER,
    dayOfWeek INTEGER,
    start_time_local TEXT,
    end_time_local TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE store_timezone (
    store_id INTEGER,
    timezone_str TEXT
);

These commands create tables that match the schema of the CSV files.

5. Exit the SQLite command-line interface by typing .exit and pressing Enter.

6. Now, you can run the Python script (app.py or any other name you used) that contains the load_csv_to_db() function. The function will read the CSV files and insert the data into the corresponding tables in the store.db SQLite database.

  load_csv_to_db()##code

This will load the CSV data into the SQLite database, and you can proceed to run the generate_report() function to generate the report based on the loaded data.
